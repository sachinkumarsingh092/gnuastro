# Bootstrap configuration for GNU Astronomy Utilities
#
# This file will be read by the ./bootstrap script and everything that
# is defined here will be replaced with the variables defined
# there. ./bootstrap is a script made by Gnulib in order to run Gnulib
# and any other operation that is necessary to do on the version
# controlled source prior to running ./configure.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE(s) FOR GNUASTRO:
#
#    - We have separated the variables defined here into three
#      categories as clearly seen below. The main reason is that if
#      Gnulib's template bootstrap.conf ever changes in the future, we
#      know exactly which parts we have modified for Gnuastro and so,
#      we can easily update this template.

# Gnuastro specific configuration variables
# =========================================
#
# These are configurations that were added specifically for
# bootstrapping Gnuastro, these variables were originally not in this
# configuration file, we have copied them from the bootstrap script
# since everything here is going to be replaced with the same variable
# that was defined there.




# Run the genauthors script to create the AUTHORS file which is
# necessary in autoreconf. Recall that we have to satisfy the GNU
# Coding Standards which require this file's existence and autoreconf
# will complain if its not here.

# Extra options we want to have added to the execution of gnulib-tool
# for Gnuastro. See the `gnulib_tool_options' variable in bootstrap
# for the default options that will be used and as a template.

# This name will be appended to the Gnulib's Automake variables. By
# default the ./bootstrap script takes the long package name as a
# reference, but for Gnuastro, since the long package name contains a
# space, it is replaced with astronomy-utilities, and so Automake will
# complain (for example: bad characters in variable name
# 'libastronomy-utilities_la_SOURCES'). So we are also redefining it
# here. This name is irrelevant for the final process.
