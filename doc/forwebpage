# Prepare all Gnuastro webpages in a temporary directory, move the updated
# files to the destination directory (local CVS checkout) and commit the
# changes to the gnu.org/software/gnuastro webpage. Finally, delete the
# temporary directory. See below for setting up the CVS checkout for the
# first time. NOTE: This script is defined to be run in Gnuastro's `doc/'
# directory. It should not be called from anywhere else.
#
#    # IMPORTANT: do not end the destination directory with a `/'.
#    ./forwebpage /destination/directory
#
# The temporary directory will be named `/destination/directory_tmp'.
#
# This script will first run gendocs.sh on the Texinfo source which creates
# the standrard GNU webpage style documentation page. Then it does some
# modifications to the HTMLs produced:
#
# 1. Add a CSS sytlesheet.
# 2. Add MathJax.
# 3. Add a "GNU Astronomy Utilities manual" title on the top.
# 4. Add a link to read in different formats in the bottom.
# 5. If MathJax was used in a page, add a link to Javascript.html
# 6. Add a link to the main Gnuastro webpage on the bottom.
# 7. Remove the border from cartouche in the HTML.
#
# After making all these changes, it copies all the necessry files in
# in the folder that will be linked to the GNU servers and it will run
# CVS to upload them there.
#
#
# NOTE FOR FIRST TIME
# -------------------
#
# The GNU webpage is version controlled by CVS and operates based on
# it. CVS is no longer popular anymore, but the commands below should
# be enough for the initial setup. Afterwards, you can just run this
# script.
#
#   1. Add `export CVS_RSH=ssh' to your ~/.bashrc
#
#   2. Choose the top directory to keep your local copy of the webpage
#      (TOPWEBCHECKOUT). Note that especially because of MathJax,
#      there are a HUGE number of files and since everything is
#      generated from the single gnuastro.texi file, there is no need
#      to take up your backup space. So you can put that directory in
#      some directory that is not backed up, it can be anywhere.
#
#   3. Make a directory to keep the copy of the webpage.
#         $ mkdir $TOPWEBCHECKOUT
#
#   4. Set the CVSROOT environment variable, just replace SAVANNAHID
#      with your Savannah ID, it will use the key you have registered
#      on Savannah for authentication.
#         $ export CVSROOT=:ext:SAVANNAHID@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/web/gnuastro
#
#   5. Checkout a copy of the webpage:
#         $ cvs checkout ./
#
#
# New pages
# ---------
#
# When a new page is added, after all the "cvs commit: Examining ..."
# reports, you will see a line for each new file starting with a
# '?'. Assume FILES is a string of all these files (that have a `?' in
# the CVS commit of this script). Run these commands to go into your
# local checkout and add those files to the repository.
#
#     $ cd $TOPWEBCHECKOUT/gnuastro
#     $ cvs add FILES
#     $ cvs commit -m "New file added"

# The date that is printed on the manual is generated by looking at the

# generate the version number). This can cause confusion, since the version
# number (coming from the commit) will have a different date in the
# revision history. To avoid this, here we check if the `../configure'
# modification date is similar to that on 'gnuastro.texi' or not. If it
# isn't a warning error is printed to let the user know, so they take the
# appropriate action.

Different ../configure and ./gnuastro.texi modification dates
=============================================================

The version number printed on the manual was generated with ../configure,
however the date (that is printed beside the version number) comes from the
last modification date of ./gnuastro.texi. This can cause confusion if it
is put on the webpage like this!

So please resolve this conflict!

If everything is OK and "autoconf -f" or bootstrapping was done today, you
can run "touch ./gnuastro.texi" to give it the current modification date. If
not, please regenerate ./configure (with autoconf -f) and run "make
distcheck" (to see if everything is working), then "touch
./gnuastro.texi" to upload the documentation to the webpage.

The webpage is the official place for the manual and it is very important
that it does not cause confusions for readers who are not too familiar with
the inner workings of these scripts.
