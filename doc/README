Documentation of GNU Astronomy Utilities
========================================

Copyright (C) 2015-2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
See the end of the file for license conditions.

This directory contains the documentation (manual) of GNU Astronomy
Utilities (Gnuastro) and also all the files necessary for the Gnuastro
webpage. Note that only the basic files needed to make the webpage are
version controlled. The generated files are not.

Documentation (manual):
-----------------------

The documentation of Gnuastro is written in Texinfo. The main source
file is 'gnuastro.texi'.

Webpage (only for maintainer)
-----------------------------

The top Gnuastro webpage files are also held here, after all, a webpage is
another form of documentation. To update the webpage, run the following
script:

      $ ./forwebpage

This script will generate the webpage using Gnulib's gendocs.sh script
(which was part of the bootstrapping process), then it will copy them all
in a specified directory anywhere you like (specified by the TOPWEBCHECKOUT
shell variable). You don't have to version control any of the files in that
directory, but it is easiest to have a fixed place since CVS needs a local
copy. Unfortunately the GNU webpage runs on CVS! Read the top comments of
the 'forwebpage' script for instructions on what to do for the first time
and later times.

Update MathJax (for the webpage, only for maintainer)
-----------------------------------------------------

There is a script in the 'MathJax' directory on the Gnuastro webpage
directory to update MathJax ('addmissing.sh'). You can get a recent
version of MathJax from its webpage and put it in the correct place
(see the comments in the script). That script will then add all the
new files from MathJax to the checked out files and then you can use
'cvs -nq update' and 'cvs add' to add all the new files and
directories. Just note that CVS is an antique(!) and so you have to
add all the files in separate directories separately, first add the
directory, then CVS will find the untracked files inside it and add
them one by one!
