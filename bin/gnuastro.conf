 # The default 'minmapsize' is set to the maximum possible value for signed
 # 64-bit integers (half the full logical size of a 64-bit system, which is
 # larger than 9 x 10^18 bytes). Effectively, this means that forced
 # memory-mapping will be disabled. Therefore memory-mapping will only
 # happen when memory cannot be allocated with the RAM (for any reason,
 # mainly not having enough space). On 32-bit systems, this will
 # automatically be read by the C library as the largest possible memory in
 # those systems (~4.3 x 10^9 bytes).
