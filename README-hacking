Hacking into GNU Astronomy Utilities
====================================

Copyright (C) 2015-2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
See the end of the file for license conditions.

This file is intended for those who are building and installing the version
controlled source of GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) and not the tarball
release (see the 'README' file for the easier tarball installation and
general guide). This file is thus not distributed with the
tarball. Gnuastro's version controlled source can be cloned by running the
following command:

    git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnuastro.git

The cloned 'gnuastro' directory only contains files that were actually
written by hand as part of Gnuastro and not automatically generated files,
or files that we have taken fully from other packages (for example the GNU
Portability Library, Gnulib). Therefore, immediately after cloning,
Gnuastro is not ready to be configured, built, checked, or installed. You
have to "bootstrap" it first. Bootstrapping is the process of doing all the
automatic steps on the version controlled files and make everything ready
for you to run './configure' and compile a program. All these extra files
are automatically included in the release tarball for easy installation,
hence bootstrapping is not necessary when configuring from the tarball.

All the operations that are necessary to prepare you to run './configure'
in the version controlled source are managed by the 'bootstrap' file in
this top directory. 'bootstrap' is part of the Gnulib and is the only
outsider file that is version controlled in Gnuastro. It is configured with
the 'bootstrap.conf' file. Therefore, if you want to customize it, be sure
to keep the 'bootstrap' file untouched and only do your changes in
'bootstrap.conf' (any change in 'bootstrap' will be overridden when Gnulib
releases an update). 'bootstrap.conf' is heavily commented so you should be
able to easily go through it. It is read at the start of 'bootstrap'
operations and has hooks for you to define any operation after Gnulib
inclusion, and after all its operations are done.



Dependencies
------------

To bootstrap Gnuastro, you will need to have the following
dependencies. These are more fully discussed in the "Bootstrapping
dependencies" section of the Gnuastro book. The last three are probably
already present in your operating system's package management system.

  - Gnulib and GNU Autoconf-archive. These two packages can be cloned by
    the bootstrap script automatically. However, if you don't already have
    them, we recommed to clone them separately as discussed below. They
    should be in the same directory (let's call it 'DEVDIR', can be any
    directory). These packages are regularly updated, so run `git pull'
    within the cloned directories to keep them up to date before
    bootstrapping. See the "Bootstrapping dependencies" and "Bootstrapping"
    sections of the book for more information.

        DEVDIR=/home/yourusername/Development
        cd $DEVDIR
        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gnulib.git
        git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/autoconf-archive.git

  - TeX Live. It is used to generate the pdf and dvi figures and
    manuals. You will need the PGFPlots and TiKZ packages to generate some
    of the figures. You can download and install it from its official
    webpage at: https://www.tug.org/texlive/

  - GNU Autotools: Autoconf, Automake, Libtool, and M4 to do all the
    preparations for an easy and portable configuration and build
    system.

  - help2man to generate man pages from the --help output.

  - ImageMagick to convert some of the graphic formats to other formats to
    use in different manual outputs.



Bootstrapping
-------------

The bootstrapping process is very simple. The simplest (and not
recommended) way is to just run the following command which will clone
Gnulib and download the appropriate GNU Autoconf archives directly under
you cloned 'gnuastro' directory.

    ./bootstrap             # Needs internet connection every time.

The recommended way is to clone Gnulib and the Autoconf archives separately
(see above), then tell the script where to look for them. You will not need
an internet connection every time you decide to bootstrap, your 'gnuastro'
directory will be much cleaner, and if your other packages or projects
need these tools, you won't need to have multiple copies. Note that during
development, sometimes it can be convenient to remove all non-version
controlled files.

   ./bootstrap --copy --gnulib-srcdir=$DEVDIR/gnulib

Run ./bootstrap with the --help option for more information on running
this script.



CAUTION
-------

This file ('README-hacking') is only distributed with the version
controlled source and not the Gnuastro tarball. Without this file, the
'bootstrap' script will complain about not being checked-out and abort. So
be sure to keep this file where ever you want to run 'bootstrap'.
