# Script to rebuild and test a utility during development.
#
# During the development of Gnuastro, you often make changes in a utility
# then need to rebuild and run it with special arguments and options (to
# test your work). This script is made to facilitate this process. It will
# take these steps:
#
#   1. Delete an existing utility executable.
#
#   2. Run Make on all Gnuastro.
#
#   3. If Make was successful, then go into the output directory, and run
#      utility with the given arguments and options. The executable is run
#      within an output directory (possibly different from the source or
#      build directories) so if you need to make lots of temporary test
#      files, there they won't get mixed up with non-output files.
#
# Combined with the 'developer-build', this script can be used to greatly
# simplify the development process. After running that script once, for
# subsequent builds during your development, you can run this script from
# the top source directory (by running './tests/during-dev.sh', or giving
# this to the 'compile' command in Emacs). Note that you have to set the
# first few variables (directories, utility name, arguments and options)
# manually before each major development activity.
#
# This file will be changed alot during development. So please make sure
# you have left the variable values empty before committing. This will
# remind each developer running this script to set the values based on
# their particular work. Alternatively you can reset this file to its
# version controlled status before committing your main work with the
# command below:
#
#     git checkout -- tests/during-dev.sh
#
# This file can also be used as a model to write a test for the work you
# have done (to be checked with 'make check'). Just copy and paste an
# existing test from the utility and replace the last few lines based on
# this file.

# SET INPUT PARAMETERS
# ====================

# Set the basic test directories. If you are building over the source
# directory, then set 'builddir' to './'. If you want the outputs to be in
# the top source directory, set it to './'. Since 'build' is the assumed
# symbolic link in 'developer-build', it is also assumed in the version
# controlled version of this script. Note, if your directory names have
# space characters in them, quote the full value
numjobs=8
builddir=build
outdir="/home/sachin/gnuastro_dev/during-dev-out"



# Set the utility name, along with its arguments and options. NOTE, for
# multiple arguments and options, please put them all between quotation
# marks so the space characters are included. If there are spaces in the
# values of the options or arguments, quote them two times (once for this
# script, and once for the utility. In such cases it might be easier to
# just add the argument/option to the final script that runs the utility
# rather than these variables.
utilname=match
arguments="../during-dev-out/kdtree-input.fits ../during-dev-out/match-query.fits"
options="--ccol1=1,2 --ccol2=1,2 --aperture=1 --kdtree=internal"





# RUN THE PROCEDURES
# ==================

# Stop the script if there are any errors.

# First, make sure the variables are set. Note that arguments and options
# are not absolutly vital! so they are not checked here. The utility will
# warn and halt if it needs them.
